Quiz
======================
The Quiz module lets you create graded assessments in Drupal. A Quiz is given as
a series of questions. Answers are then stored in the database. Scores and
results are displayed during or after the quiz. Administrators can provide
automatic or manual feedback. See all the features below! This module can be
used as

*   an object in a larger LMS, or a supplemental classroom activity
*   a standalone activity (audio, video, rich text in questions/answers)
*   a self-learning program, using adaptive mode with multiple answer tries
*   a training program, with multiple improving attempts

The quiz module allows users to administer a quiz, as a sequence of questions, and
track the answers given. It allows for the creation of questions (and their answers),
and organizes these questions into a quiz. Its target audience includes educational
institutions, online training programs, employers, and people who just want to add a
fun activity for their visitors to their Drupal site.

The quiz module has a plethora of permission options. Unless you take care setting
your permissions, the quiz module might not do everything you want it to do.
