Long Answer
==================

This module provides long-answer (essay, multi-paragraph) questions
to the quiz module. .

A long-answer question is designed to provide the quiz taker a
lengthy area to expand on ideas. Common forms of long-answer questions
include essays, single paragraph responses, hypothesis design problems,
outlines and summaries, and lengthier math problems where the focus is
on showing work rather than simply getting the correct answer.

Long answer questions make use of the quiz question framework
`quiz_question.module`. The functions in this file are largely used for
grading long answer questions. Most of the real logic is in
`long_answer.classes.inc`.
